    Calculates the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between two strings.

    In addition to insertions, deletions and substitutions,
    Damerau-Levenshtein considers adjacent transpositions.

    This version is based on an iterative version of the Wagner-Fischer algorithm.

    Usage::

        >>> damerau_levenshtein('kitten', 'sitting')
        3
        >>> damerau_levenshtein('kitten', 'kittne')
        1
        >>> damerau_levenshtein('', '')
        0
