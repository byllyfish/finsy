def classic_levenshtein(string_1, string_2):  # -> int:

    Calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings.

    This version is easier to read, but significantly slower than the version
    below (up to several orders of magnitude). Useful for learning, less so
    otherwise.

    Usage::

        >>> classic_levenshtein('kitten', 'sitting')
        3
        >>> classic_levenshtein('kitten', 'kitten')
        0
        >>> classic_levenshtein('', '')
        0
